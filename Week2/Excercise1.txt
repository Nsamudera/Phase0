1. Newton Second Law

STORE "mass" with value of 600
STORE "acceleration" with value of 2
STORE "force" without any value

CALCULATE "mass" times "acceleration"
SET "force" value with calculation result

DISPLAY "force"

//Algorithm

1. Pick a year to check whether it is a leap year or not.
2. Check to see if the chosen year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100
3. Check to see if the chosen year is divisible by 4, 100, and 400.
4. If the year meets the criteria set in 2 or 3, then it is a leap year.
5. If the year does not meet either criteria, then it is not a leap year.
  
//Pseudocode
STORE "year" with chosen value

IF "year" modulo by 4 equal to 0
  and
  IF "year" modulo by 100 is not equal to 0
    DISPLAY '"year" is a leap year'

ELSE IF "year" modulo by 4 equal to 0
  and
  IF "year" modulo by 100 equal to 0
    and
    IF "year" modulo by 400 equal to 0
      DISPLAY '"year" is a leap year'

ELSE
  DISPLAY '"year" is not a leap year'

3. Laundry Day

//Algorithm
1. Open the washing machine and make sure that there is nothing inside.
2. Put a piece of clothing inside the washing machine.
3. Count the total amount of clothings that is put inside the machine.
4. Once the total amount of clothings reaches 20, start the machine.

//Pseudocode
STORE "laundry amount" with 0

WHILE "laundry amount" < 20
  ADD "laundry amount" by 1

DISPLAY 'Laundry is ready to be used'

4. Periksa Kuku

//Algorithm
1. Call the first student.
2. Check the student's nails.
3. If the student's nails is longer than the criteria, then punish the student.
4. If the student's nails is meets the criteria, then praise the student.
5. Count the student and add it to the total of students checked.
6. Repeat the process until all 40 students are checked.

//Pseudocode
STORE "nail_length" with chosen value
STORE "student_nail" with any value
STORE "student_count" to 1

WHILE "student_count" <= 40
  DISPLAY "student_count"
  IF "student_nail" is less than "nail_length"
      DISPLAY 'Nail is acceptable. Give praise'
  ELSE
      DISPLAY 'Nail is not acceptable. Give punishment'    
  ADD "student_count" by 1
